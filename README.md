  R-Weekly Curation Calendar Dashboard
</h1>

This repository contains a dashboard for viewing the [R-Weekly](https://rweekly.org) curator team calendar.

> R Weekly was founded on May 20, 2016. R is growing very quickly, and there are lots of great blogs, tutorials and other formats of resources coming out every day. R Weekly wants to keep track of these great things in the R community and make it more accessible to everyone.

The R-Weekly team is composed of volunteers who are passionate about the R community. Each R-Weekly issue is assigned a curator who edits the issue content, launches an internal poll for team voting of the top highlights, and publishes the issue. Additonal details on the curation process can be found on the [Release Editor FAQ](https://github.com/rweekly/rweekly.org/wiki/Release-Editor-FAQ). The team would welcome new curators! You can learn more about joining the team from the project [README](https://github.com/rweekly/rweekly.org#join-us).

The curation calendar dashboard is made possible by the following open-source projects and packages:

* [Quarto](https://quarto.org): Scientific and publishing system.
* [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/): Open-source content collaboration platform.
* Notable R packages:
    + [`{targets}`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/): Function-oriented Make-like declarative workflows for R.
    + [`{toastui}`](https://dreamrs.github.io/toastui/index.html): HTML widgets for the [TOAST UI](https://ui.toast.com/) JavaScript libraries.
    + [`{reactable}`](https://glin.github.io/reactable): Interactive data tables for R. 
    + [`{calendar}`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=calendar): Provides functions to create, read, write, and work with `iCalendar` files.
